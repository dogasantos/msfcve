It is designed to be a flexible, efficient solution for distributing geospatial data from a variety of sources such as Geographic Information System (GIS) databases, web-based data, and personal datasets. In the GeoServer versions < 2.23.6, >= 2.24.0, < 2.24.4 and >= 2.25.0, < 2.25.1, multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions. An attacker can abuse this by sending a POST request with a malicious xpath expression to execute arbitrary commands as root on the system.",

          "description": "Acronis Cyber Protect or Backup is an enterprise backup/recovery solution for all, compute, storage and application resources. Businesses and Service Providers are using it to protect and backup all IT assets in their IT environment. The Acronis Cyber Protect appliance, in its default configuration, allows the anonymous registration of new protect/backup agents on new endpoints. This API endpoint also generates bearer tokens which the agent then uses to authenticate to the appliance. As the management web console is running on the same port as the API for the agents, this bearer token is also valid for any actions on the web console. This allows an attacker with network access to the appliance to start the registration of a new agent, retrieve a bearer token that provides admin access to the available functions in the web console. The web console contains multiple possibilities to execute arbitrary commands on both the agents (e.g., via PreCommands for a backup) and also the appliance (e.g., via a Validation job on the agent of the appliance). These options can easily be set with the provided bearer token, which leads to a complete compromise of all agents and the appliance itself. You can either use the module `auxiliary/gather/acronis_cyber_protect_machine_info_disclosure` to collect target info for exploitation in this module. Or just run this module standalone and it will try to exploit the first online endpoint matching your target and payload settings configured at the module. Acronis Cyber Protect 15 (Windows, Linux) before build 29486 and Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 (Windows, Linux) before build 16545 are vulnerable.",

When the control is installed with these products, the function \"LaunchTriPane\" will use ShellExecute to launch \"hh.exe\", with user controlled data as parameters. Because of this, the \"-decompile\" option can be abused to write arbitrary files on the remote system. Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine, and then upload another mof file, which enables Windows Management Instrumentation service to execute it. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista. On the other hand, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.

This allows the injection of the -XXaltjvm option to load a jvm.dll from a remote UNC path into the java process. Thus an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a browser user. This flaw was fixed in Oct. 2012 and affects JRE <= 1.6.35 and <= 1.7.07. In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that does not serve SMB (In most cases, this means non-Windows hosts). Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. Alternatively, a UNC path containing a jvm.dll can be specified, bypassing the Windows limitation for the Metasploit host.",

The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and write memory in the specified process. This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM) and infect it by installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary. The vulnerable software can be found here: https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be connected in order to leverage this vulnerability. This exploit is not opsec-safe due to the user being logged out as part of the exploitation process.",

The parameter to exec() includes the GET parameter `democ`, which is controlled by the user and not properly sanitised/escaped.

          "description": "InvoiceShelf is an open-source web & mobile app that helps you track expenses, payments, create professional invoices & estimates and is based on the PHP framework Laravel. InvoiceShelf has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to conduct PHP deserialization attacks. This is possible when the `SESSION_DRIVER=cookie` option is set on the default InvoiceShelf .env file meaning that any session will be stored as a ciphered value inside a cookie. These sessions are made from a specially crafted JSON containing serialized data which is then ciphered using Laravel's encrypt() function. An attacker in possession of the `APP_KEY` would therefore be able to retrieve the cookie, uncipher it and modify the serialized data in order to get arbitrary deserialization on the affected server, allowing them to achieve remote command execution. InvoiceShelf version `1.3.0` and lower is vulnerable. As it allows remote code execution, adversaries could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands, potentially resulting in complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.",

          "description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in multiple D-Link network products, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary command to the UPnP via a crafted M-SEARCH packet. Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), by default is enabled in most D-Link devices, on the port 1900. An attacker can perform a remote command execution by injecting the payload into the `Search Target` (ST) field of the SSDP M-SEARCH discover packet. After successful exploitation, an attacker will have full access with `root` user privileges. NOTE: Staged meterpreter payloads might core dump on the target, so use stage-less meterpreter payloads when using the Linux Dropper target. Some D-Link devices do not have the `wget` command so configure `echo` as flavor with the command set CMDSTAGER::FLAVOR echo. The following D-Link network products and firmware are vulnerable: - D-Link Router model GO-RT-AC750 revisions Ax with firmware v1.01 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-300 revisions Ax with firmware v1.06 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-300 revisions Bx with firmware v2.15 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-600 revisions Bx with firmware v2.18 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-645 revisions Ax with firmware v1.05 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-815 revisions Bx with firmware v1.04 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-816L revisions Bx with firmware v2.06 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-817LW revisions Ax with firmware v1.04b01_hotfix or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-818LW revisions Bx with firmware v2.05b03_Beta08 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-822 revisions Bx with firmware v2.03b01 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-822 revisions Cx with firmware v3.12b04 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-823 revisions Ax with firmware v1.00b06_Beta or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-845L revisions Ax with firmware v1.02b05 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-860L revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b05 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-859 revisions Ax with firmware v1.06b01Beta01 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-860L revisions Ax with firmware v1.10b04 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-860L revisions Bx with firmware v2.03b03 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-865L revisions Ax with firmware v1.07b01 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-868L revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b04 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-868L revisions Bx with firmware v2.05b02 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-869 revisions Ax with firmware v1.03b02Beta02 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-880L revisions Ax with firmware v1.08b04 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-890L/R revisions Ax with firmware v1.11b01_Beta01 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-885L/R revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b05 or older; - D-Link Router model DIR-895L/R revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b10 or older; - probably more looking at the scale of impacted devices :-(",
