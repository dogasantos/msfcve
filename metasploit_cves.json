ClassFinder is a replacement for classForName back in JDK 6. It allows untrusted code to obtain a reference and have access to a restricted package in JDK 7, which can be used to abuse sun.awt.SunToolkit (a restricted package). With sun.awt.SunToolkit, we can actually invoke getField() by abusing findMethod() in Statement.invokeInternal() (but getField() must be public, and that's not always the case in JDK 6) in order to access Statement.acc's private field, modify AccessControlContext, and then disable Security Manager. Once Security Manager is disabled, we can execute arbitrary Java code.

          "description": "The exploit takes advantage of two issues in JDK 7: The ClassFinder and MethodFinder.findMethod(). Both were newly introduced in JDK 7. ClassFinder is a replacement for classForName back in JDK 6. It allows untrusted code to obtain a reference and have access to a restricted package in JDK 7, which can be used to abuse sun.awt.SunToolkit (a restricted package). With sun.awt.SunToolkit, we can actually invoke getField() by abusing findMethod() in Statement.invokeInternal() (but getField() must be public, and that's not always the case in JDK 6) in order to access Statement.acc's private field, modify AccessControlContext, and then disable Security Manager. Once Security Manager is disabled, we can execute arbitrary Java code. Our exploit has been tested successfully against multiple platforms, including: IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome; Windows, Ubuntu, OS X, Solaris, etc.",

By re-setting this property on the exception object's prototype, the chrome-based defineProperty method is made available. With the defineProperty method, functions belonging to window and document can be overridden with a function that gets called from chrome-privileged context. From here, another vulnerability in the crypto.generateCRMFRequest function is used to \"peek\" into the context's private scope. Since the window does not have a chrome:// URL, the insecure parts of Components.classes are not available, so instead the AddonManager API is invoked to silently install a malicious plugin.",

          "description": "On versions of Firefox from 5.0 to 15.0.1, the InstallTrigger global, when given invalid input, would throw an exception that did not have an __exposedProps__ property set. By re-setting this property on the exception object's prototype, the chrome-based defineProperty method is made available. With the defineProperty method, functions belonging to window and document can be overridden with a function that gets called from chrome-privileged context. From here, another vulnerability in the crypto.generateCRMFRequest function is used to \"peek\" into the context's private scope. Since the window does not have a chrome:// URL, the insecure parts of Components.classes are not available, so instead the AddonManager API is invoked to silently install a malicious plugin.",

The Object.create operation can be used to cause a type confusion between a PropertyArray and a NameDictionary. The payload is executed within the rwx region of the sandboxed renderer process. This module can target the renderer process (target 0), but Google Chrome must be launched with the --no-sandbox flag for the payload to execute successfully. Alternatively, this module can use CVE-2019-1458 to escape the renderer sandbox (target 1). This will only work on vulnerable versions of Windows (e.g Windows 7) and the exploit can only be triggered once. Additionally the exploit can cause the target machine to restart when the session is terminated. A BSOD is also likely to occur when the system is shut down or rebooted.",

The relative read and write is then used to modify a UInt64Array (uint64_aarw) which is used for read and writing from absolute memory. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory, which is then replaced with the payload shellcode. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process, so the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.",

On exploitation a crontab.old backup file will be created by Xorg. This module will remove the .old file and restore crontab after successful exploitation.

A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with AIX 7.1 and 7.2, and should also work with 6.1. Due to permission restrictions of the crontab in AIX, this module does not use cron, and instead overwrites /etc/passwd in order to create a new user with root privileges. All currently logged in users need to be included when /etc/passwd is overwritten, else AIX will throw 'Cannot get \"LOGNAME\" variable' when attempting to change user. The Xorg '-fp' parameter used in the OpenBSD exploit does not work on AIX, and is replaced by '-config', in conjuction with ANSI-C quotes to inject newlines when overwriting /etc/passwd.",

This is possible when the current user is allowed to create `git hooks`, which is the default for administrative users. For non-administrative users, the permission needs to be specifically granted by an administrator. To achieve code execution, the module authenticates to the Gitea web interface, creates a temporary repository, sets a `post-receive` git hook with the payload and creates a dummy file in the repository. This last action will trigger the git hook and execute the payload. Everything is done through the web interface. It has been mitigated in version 1.13.0 by setting the Gitea `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` configuration setting to `true` by default. This disables this feature and prevents all users (including admin) from creating custom git hooks. This module has been tested successfully against docker versions 1.12.5, 1.12.6 and 1.13.6 with `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` set to `false`, and on version 1.12.6 on Windows.",

          "description": "This module leverages a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in the OpenAM identity and access management solution. The vulnerability arises from a Java deserialization flaw in OpenAM's implementation of the Jato framework and can be triggered by a simple one-line GET or POST request to a vulnerable endpoint. Successful exploitation yields code execution on the target system as the service user. This vulnerability also affects the ForgeRock identity platform which is built on top of OpenAM and is thus is susceptible to the same issue.",

A bug in the privileges system allows a teacher to add themselves as a manager to their own class. They can then add any other users, and thus look to add someone with manager privileges on the system (not just the class). After adding a system manager, a 'loginas' feature is used to access their account. Next the system is reconfigured to allow for all users to install an addon/plugin. Then a malicious theme is uploaded and creates an RCE. If all of that is a success, we revert permissions for managers to system default and remove our malicoius theme. Manual cleanup to remove students from the class is required. This module was tested against Moodle version 3.9",

On operating systems which have case-insensitive file systems, like Windows and OS X, Git clients can be convinced to retrieve and overwrite sensitive configuration files in the .git directory which can allow arbitrary code execution if a vulnerable client can be convinced to perform certain actions (for example, a checkout) against a malicious Git repository.

The third vulnerability with similar characteristics only affects Mercurial clients on Windows, where Windows \"short names\" (MS-DOS-compatible 8.3 format) are supported.

Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with particular parameters. 3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval statement, allowing perl code injection.",

A default interpolator allows for string lookups that can lead to Remote Code Execution. This is due to a logic flaw that makes the \"script\", \"dns\" and \"url\" lookup keys interpolated by default, as opposed to what it should be, according to the documentation of the StringLookupFactory class. Those keys allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via lookups primarily using the \"script\" key. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities, the following requirements must be met: Run a version of Apache Commons Text from version 1.5 to 1.9 Use the StringSubstitutor interpolator Target should run JDK < 15",

          "description": "Acronis Cyber Protect or Backup is an enterprise backup/recovery solution for all, compute, storage and application resources. Businesses and Service Providers are using it to protect and backup all IT assets in their IT environment. The Acronis Cyber Protect appliance, in its default configuration, allows the anonymous registration of new protect/backup agents on new endpoints. This API endpoint also generates bearer tokens which the agent then uses to authenticate to the appliance. As the management web console is running on the same port as the API for the agents, this bearer token is also valid for any actions on the web console. This allows an attacker with network access to the appliance to start the registration of a new agent, retrieve a bearer token that provides admin access to the available functions in the web console. The web console contains multiple possibilities to execute arbitrary commands on both the agents (e.g., via PreCommands for a backup) and also the appliance (e.g., via a Validation job on the agent of the appliance). These options can easily be set with the provided bearer token, which leads to a complete compromise of all agents and the appliance itself. You can either use the module `auxiliary/gather/acronis_cyber_protect_machine_info_disclosure` to collect target info for exploitation in this module. Or just run this module standalone and it will try to exploit the first online endpoint matching your target and payload settings configured at the module. Acronis Cyber Protect 15 (Windows, Linux) before build 29486 and Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 (Windows, Linux) before build 16545 are vulnerable.",

The first vulnerability is that the management interface is bound to all IP addresses and not just the loop back interface as the documentation suggests. The second vulnerability (CVE-2023-43654) allows attackers with access to the management interface to register MAR model files from arbitrary servers. The third vulnerability is that when an MAR file is loaded, it can contain a YAML configuration file that when deserialized by snakeyaml, can lead to loading an arbitrary Java class.",

This occurs when an attacker serializes a \"ForeignOpaqueReference\" class object, deserializes it on the target, and then post deserialization, calls the object's \"getReferent()\" method, which will make use of the \"ForeignOpaqueReference\" class's \"remoteJNDIName\" variable, which is under the attackers control, to do a remote loading of the JNDI address specified by \"remoteJNDIName\" via the \"lookup()\" function. This can in turn lead to a deserialization vulnerability whereby an attacker supplies the address of a HTTP server hosting a malicious Java class file, which will then be loaded into the Oracle Weblogic process's memory and an attempt to create a new instance of the attacker's class will be made. Attackers can utilize this to execute arbitrary Java code during the instantiation of the object, thereby getting remote code execution as the \"oracle\" user. This module exploits this vulnerability to trigger the JNDI connection to a LDAP server we control. The LDAP server will then respond with a remote reference response that points to a HTTP server that we control, where the malicious Java class file will be hosted. Oracle Weblogic will then make a HTTP request to retrieve the malicious Java class file, at which point our HTTP server will serve up the malicious class file and Oracle Weblogic will instantiate an instance of that class, granting us RCE as the \"oracle\" user.

The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer to the task_struct.

          "description": "This module exploits CVE-2019-2215, which is a use-after-free in Binder in the Android kernel. The bug is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows for a full compromise of a vulnerable device. If chained with a browser renderer exploit, this bug could fully compromise a device through a malicious website. The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer to the task_struct. Finally the bug is triggered again in order to overwrite the addr_limit, making all memory (including kernel memory) accessible as part of the user-space memory range in our process and allowing arbitrary reading and writing of kernel memory.",

It was initially found in the wild in Japan, but other regions such as English, Chinese, Korean, etc, were targeted as well. The vulnerability is due to how the mshtml!CDoc::SetMouseCapture function handles a reference during an event. An attacker first can setup two elements, where the second is the child of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent element. The onlosecapture event seems to require two setCapture() calls to trigger, one for the parent element, one for the child. When the setCapture() call for the child element is called, it finally triggers the event, which allows the attacker to cause an arbitrary memory release using document.write(), which in particular frees up a 0x54-byte memory. The exact size of this memory may differ based on the version of IE. After the free, an invalid reference will still be kept and pass on to more functions, eventuall this arrives in function MSHTML!CTreeNode::GetInterface, and causes a crash (or arbitrary code execution) when this function attempts to use this reference to call what appears to be a PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset (0x00). To mimic the same exploit found in the wild, this module will try to use the same DLL from Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 to leverage the attack.",

          "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It was originally found being exploited in the wild targeting Japanese and Korean IE8 users on Windows XP, around the same time frame as CVE-2013-3893, except this was kept out of the public eye by multiple research companies and the vendor until the October patch release. This issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in CDisplayPointer via the use of a \"onpropertychange\" event handler. To set up the appropriate buggy conditions, we first craft the DOM tree in a specific order, where a CBlockElement comes after the CTextArea element. If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen: a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another event called \"onselect\". The \"onselect\" event will allow us to set up for the actual event handler we want to abuse - the \"onpropertychange\" event. Since the CBlockElement is a child of CTextArea, if we do a node swap of CBlockElement in \"onselect\", this will trigger \"onpropertychange\". During \"onpropertychange\" event handling, a free of the CDisplayPointer object can be forced by using an \"Unselect\" (other approaches also apply), but a reference of this freed memory will still be kept by CDoc::ScrollPointerIntoView, specifically after the CDoc::GetLineInfo call, because it is still trying to use that to update CDisplayPointer's position. When this invalid reference arrives in QIClassID, a crash finally occurs due to accessing the freed memory. By controlling this freed memory, it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",

          "description": "This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in the KeyScript ActiveX control from keyhelp.ocx. It is packaged in several products or GE, such as Proficy Historian 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, and 3.1, Proficy HMI/SCADA 5.1 and 5.0, Proficy Pulse 1.0, Proficy Batch Execution 5.6, and SI7 I/O Driver between 7.20 and 7.42. When the control is installed with these products, the function \"LaunchTriPane\" will use ShellExecute to launch \"hh.exe\", with user controlled data as parameters. Because of this, the \"-decompile\" option can be abused to write arbitrary files on the remote system. Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine, and then upload another mof file, which enables Windows Management Instrumentation service to execute it. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista. On the other hand, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3",

This bug was discovered being used in-the-wild and was previously known as the \"iepeers\" vulnerability. The name comes from Microsoft's suggested workaround to block access to the iepeers.dll file. According to Nico Waisman, \"The bug itself is when trying to persist an object using the setAttribute, which end up calling VariantChangeTypeEx with both the source and the destination being the same variant. So if you send as a variant an IDISPATCH the algorithm will try to do a VariantClear of the destination before using it. This will end up on a call to PlainRelease which deref the reference and clean the object.\" NOTE: Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 5 are not affected.",

This flaw was fixed in Oct. 2012 and affects JRE <= 1.6.35 and <= 1.7.07. In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that does not serve SMB (In most cases, this means non-Windows hosts). Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. Alternatively, a UNC path containing a jvm.dll can be specified, bypassing the Windows limitation for the Metasploit host.",

          "description": "This exploit takes advantage of a use after free vulnerability in Google Chrome 72.0.3626.119 running on Windows 7 x86. The FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer function can return multiple references to the same ArrayBuffer object, which can be freed and overwritten with sprayed objects. The dangling ArrayBuffer reference can be used to access the sprayed objects, allowing arbitrary memory access from Javascript. This is used to write and execute shellcode in a WebAssembly object. The shellcode is executed within the Chrome sandbox, so you must explicitly disable the sandbox for the payload to be successful.",

          "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the clfs.sys driver which comes installed by default on Windows 10 21H2, Windows 11 21H2 and Windows Server 20348 operating systems. The clfs.sys driver contains a function CreateLogFile that is used to create open and edit '*.blf' (base log format) files. Inside a .blf file there are multiple blocks of data which contain checksums to verify the integrity of the .blf file and to ensure the file looks and acts like a .blf file. However, these files can be edited with CreateFileA or with fopen and then modified with WriteFile or fwrite respectively in order to change the contents of the file and update their checksums accordingly. This exploit makes use to two different kinds of specially crafted .blf files that are edited using the technique mentioned above. There are multiple spray .blf files. The spray .blf files are specially crafted to initiate an out of bounds read which reads from a contiguous block of memory. The block of memory it reads from contains a read-write pipe that points to the address of the second type of .blf file - the trigger .blf file. The trigger .blf file is specially crafted read the SYSTEM token and write it in the process of the exploit to achieve the local privilege escalation. The exploits creates a controlled memory space by first looping over the CreatePipe function to to create thousands of read-write pipes (which take up 0x90 bytes of memory). It then releases a certain number of pipes from memory and calls CreateLogFile to open the pre-existing spray .blf files which when being opened fill the 0x90 byte gaps created by the deallocation of the pipes in memory, creating the controlled memory space. This is a very brief and high overview description of what the exploit is actually doing. For a more detailed and in depth analysis please refer to the following [reference](https://github.com/fortra/CVE-2023-28252).",

When the kernel preforms the copy of the `SecurityAttributesList`, it sets up the list of the SecurityAttribute's structure directly to the user supplied pointed. It then calls `RtlCopyUnicodeString` and `AuthzBasepCopyoutInternalSecurityAttributeValues` to copy out the names and values of the `SecurityAttribute` leading to multiple Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities in the function.",

          "description": "A use after free vulnerability exists in the `NtGdiResetDC()` function of Win32k which can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. The flaw exists due to the fact that this function calls `hdcOpenDCW()`, which performs a user mode callback. During this callback, attackers can call the `NtGdiResetDC()` function again with the same handle as before, which will result in the PDC object that is referenced by this handle being freed. The attacker can then replace the memory referenced by the handle with their own object, before passing execution back to the original `NtGdiResetDC()` call, which will now use the attacker's object without appropriate validation. This can then allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the kernel and, together with additional exploitation techniques, gain code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. This module has been tested to work on Windows 10 x64 RS1 (build 14393) and RS5 (build 17763), however previous versions of Windows 10 will likely also work.",

The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and write memory in the specified process. This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM) and infect it by installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary. The vulnerable software can be found here: https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be connected in order to leverage this vulnerability. This exploit is not opsec-safe due to the user being logged out as part of the exploitation process.",

Since `vpndownloader` is also vulnerable to DLL hijacking, a specially crafted DLL (`dbghelp.dll`) is created at the same location `vpndownloader` will be copied to get code execution with system privileges. The CVE-2020-3153 exploit has been successfully tested against Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client versions 4.5.04029, 4.5.05030 and 4.7.04056 on Windows 10 version 1909 (x64) and Windows 7 SP1 (x86); the CVE-2020-3434 exploit has been successfully tested against Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client versions 4.5.02036, 4.6.03049, 4.7.04056, 4.8.01090 and 4.8.03052 on Windows 10 version 1909 (x64) and 4.7.4056 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64).",

          "description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Data Protector 5. The overflow occurs in the creation of new folders, where the name of the folder is handled in a insecure way by the dpwindtb.dll component. While the overflow occurs in the stack, the folder name is split in fragments in this insecure copy. Because of this, this module uses egg hunting to search a non corrupted copy of the payload in the heap. On the other hand the overflowed buffer is stored in a frame protected by stack cookies, because of this SEH handler overwrite is used. Any user of HP Data Protector Express is able to create new folders and trigger the vulnerability. Moreover, in the default installation the 'Admin' user has an empty password. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution with the privileges of the \"dpwinsdr.exe\" (HP Data Protector Express Domain Server Service) process, which runs as SYSTEM by default.",

          "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code execution, publicly known as \"Sandworm\". Platforms such as Windows Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function. This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target. In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly. As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file, and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's actually the payload, and the second for the INF file. The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the type and cmd property. In the exploit, \"verb\" media command type is used, and this triggers the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, \"-3\" is used as the fake gif file's cmd property, and \"3\" is used for the INF. When the cmd is \"-3\", DoVerb will bail. But when \"3\" is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate handler for it, which will end up with C:\\Windows\\System32\\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution.",

          "description": "When an unpatched Windows 11 host loads a theme file referencing an msstyles file, Windows loads the msstyles file, and if that file's PACKME_VERSION is `999`, it then attempts to load an accompanying dll file ending in `_vrf.dll` Before loading that file, it verifies that the file is signed. It does this by opening the file for reading and verifying the signature before opening the file for execution. Because this action is performed in two discrete operations, it opens the procedure for a time of check to time of use vulnerability. By embedding a UNC file path to an SMB server we control, the SMB server can serve a legitimate, signed dll when queried for the read, but then serve a different file of the same name when the host intends to load/execute the dll.",

          "description": "This module exploits security issues in ManageEngine ADAudit Plus prior to 7006 that allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by creating a custom alert profile and leveraging its custom alert script component. The module first runs a few checks to test the provided credentials, retrieve the configured domain(s) and obtain the build number of the target ADAudit Plus server. If the credentials are valid and the target is vulnerable, the module creates an alert profile that will be triggered for any failed login attempt to the configured domain. For versions prior to build 7004, the payload is directly inserted in the custom alert script component of the alert profile. For versions 7004 and 7005, the module leverages an arbitrary file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-42847) to create a Powershell script in the alert_scripts directory that contains the payload. The name of this script is then provided as the value for the custom alert script component of the alert profile. This module requires valid credentials for an account with the privileges to create alert scripts. It has been successfully tested against ManageEngine ADAudit Plus builds 7003 and 7005 running on Windows Server 2012 R2. Successful exploitation will result in RCE as the user running ManageEngine ADAudit Plus, which will typically be the local administrator.",

This can lead to unauthorized actions such as remote code execution.

If an attacker obtains the machineKey, they can forge ViewState payloads that pass integrity checks.

          "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the SmarterTools SmarterMail software for version numbers <= 16.x or for build numbers < 6985. The vulnerable versions and builds expose three .NET remoting endpoints on port 17001, namely /Servers, /Mail and /Spool. For example, a typical installation of SmarterMail Build 6970 will have the /Servers endpoint exposed to the public at tcp://0.0.0.0:17001/Servers, where serialized .NET commands can be sent through a TCP socket connection. The three endpoints perform deserialization of untrusted data (CVE-2019-7214), allowing an attacker to send arbitrary commands to be deserialized and executed. This module exploits this vulnerability to perform .NET deserialization attacks, allowing remote code execution for any unauthenticated user under the context of the SYSTEM account. Successful exploitation results in full administrative control of the target server under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM account. This vulnerability was patched in Build 6985, where the 17001 port is no longer publicly accessible, although it can be accessible locally at 127.0.0.1:17001. Hence, this would still allow for a privilege escalation vector if the server is compromised as a low-privileged user.",

With this access, it is then possible to run a new payload on all of the NorthStar C2 compromised hosts (agents), and kill the original agent.

Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020, but older ones run on port 8040.

By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The buffer being written to is 1024 bytes in size. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. Otherwise, CVE-2010-1961 is triggered! The vulnerable code is within the \"main\" function within \"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe\" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting SEH structures. There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why at this time, but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear what is causing this either.",

This leaves userland with a valid fd table entry pointing to a free'd 'file' object. We use this bug to overwrite a SUID binary with our payload and gain root.

This is wrong, as the fd gets released via put_unused_fd() which shouldn't be used, as the fd table slot was already populated via the previous call to fd_install(). This leaves userland with a valid fd table entry pointing to a free'd 'file' object. We use this bug to overwrite a SUID binary with our payload and gain root. Linux kernel 4.14-rc1 - 5.17-rc1 are vulnerable. Successfully tested against Ubuntu 22.04.01 with kernel 5.13.12-051312-generic.",

          "description": "This exploit module takes advantage of a Docker image which has either the privileged flag, or SYS_ADMIN Linux capability. If the host kernel is vulnerable, its possible to escape the Docker image and achieve root on the host operating system. A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly. More simply put, cgroups v1 has a feature called release_agent that runs a program when a process in the cgroup terminates. If notify_on_release is enabled, the kernel runs the release_agent binary as root. By editing the release_agent file, an attacker can execute their own binary with elevated privileges, taking control of the system. However, the release_agent file is owned by root, so only a user with root access can modify it.",

          "description": "This exploit module takes advantage of a Docker image which has either the privileged flag, or SYS_ADMIN Linux capability. If the host kernel is vulnerable, its possible to escape the Docker image and achieve root on the host operating system. A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly. More simply put, cgroups v1 has a feature called release_agent that runs a program when a process in the cgroup terminates. If notify_on_release is enabled, the kernel runs the release_agent binary as root. By editing the release_agent file, an attacker can execute their own binary with elevated privileges, taking control of the system. However, the release_agent file is owned by root, so only a user with root access can modify it.",

This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of a user with an active Polkit agent. In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME.",

The vulnerability was fixed in Linux 5.16.11, 5.15.25 and 5.10.102. The module exploits this vulnerability by overwriting a suid binary with the payload, executing it, and then writing the original data back. There are two major limitations of this exploit: the offset cannot be on a page boundary (it needs to write one byte before the offset to add a reference to this page to the pipe), and the write cannot cross a page boundary. This means the payload must be less than the page size (4096 bytes).",

          "description": "Linux kernels from 5.7-rc1 prior to 5.13-rc4, 5.12.4, 5.11.21, and 5.10.37 are vulnerable to a bug in the eBPF verifier's verification of ALU32 operations in the scalar32_min_max_and function when performing AND operations, whereby under certain conditions the bounds of a 32 bit register would not be properly updated. This can be abused by attackers to conduct an out of bounds read and write in the Linux kernel and therefore achieve arbitrary code execution as the root user. The target system must be compiled with eBPF support and not have kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled set, which prevents unprivileged users from loading eBPF programs into the kernel. Note that if kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled is enabled this module can still be utilized to bypass protections such as SELinux, however the user must already be logged as a privileged user such as root.",

The vulnerability is the result of failing to verify the ability of a user to set the attributes in a running executable. Specifically, when Overlayfs sends the set attributes data to the underlying file system via `vfs_setxattr`, it fails to first verify the data by calling `cap_convert_nscap`. This vulnerability was patched by moving the call to `cap_convert_nscap` into the `vfs_setxattr` function that sets the attribute, forcing verification every time the `vfs_setxattr` is called rather than trusting the data was already verified.",

The sudoedit (aka sudo -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. by appending extra entries on /etc/sudoers allowing for execution of an arbitrary payload with root privileges. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. However THIS module only works against Ubuntu 22.04 and 22.10. This module was tested against sudo 1.9.9-1ubuntu2 on Ubuntu 22.04, and 1.9.11p3-1ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 22.10.",

Similarly, Fedora is vulnerable when the kernel crash handler is configured to change root directory before executing ABRT, causing `usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp` within the crashed task's directory to be executed. In both instances, the crash handler does not drop privileges, resulting in code execution as root.

The bug was initially introduced in 2011 and patched in 2016 in version 4.4.0-53.74, potentially affecting a large number of kernels; however this exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu (Trusty / Xenial) kernels 4.4.0 < 4.4.0-53, including Linux distros based on Ubuntu, such as Linux Mint. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled, two or more CPU cores, and SMAP must be disabled. Bypasses for SMEP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 17.3 (x86_64); Linux Mint 18 (x86_64); Ubuntu 16.04 (x86_64); and Ubuntu 16.04.2 (x86_64).",

A piece of demonstration code is present in `lib/icepay/icepay.php`, with a call to an exec(). The parameter to exec() includes the GET parameter `democ`, which is controlled by the user and not properly sanitised/escaped. After successful exploitation, an unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary OS commands. The commands run with the privileges of the web server process, typically `www-data` or `asterisk`. At a minimum, this allows an attacker to compromise the billing system and its database. The following MagnusBilling applications are vulnerable: - MagnusBilling application version 6 (all versions); - MagnusBilling application up to version 7.x without commit 7af21ed620 which fixes this vulnerability;",

It is present on more than 40 Zyxel routers and CPE devices. The remote code execution vulnerability can be exploited by chaining the local file disclosure vulnerability in the zhttpd binary that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read the entire configuration of the router via the vulnerable endpoint `/Export_Log?/data/zcfg_config.json`. With this information disclosure, the attacker can determine if the router is reachable via ssh and use the second vulnerability in the `zcmd` binary to derive the `supervisor` password exploiting a weak implementation of a password derivation algorithm using the device serial number. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as user `supervisor`.",

If successful, it plants a JSP-based backdoor in the public web directory, then executes that backdoor. The core vulnerability is a path-traversal issue in the cpio command- line utlity that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system (CVE-2015-1197). Most Linux distros have chosen not to fix it. This issue is exploitable on Red Hat-based systems (and other hosts without pax installed) running versions: * Zimbra Collaboration Suite 9.0.0 Patch 26 (and earlier) * Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.8.15 Patch 33 (and earlier) The patch simply makes \"pax\" a pre-requisite.",

Craft CMS versions between 4.0.0-RC1 - 4.4.14 are affected by this vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability occurs using a PHP object creation in the `\\craft\\controllers\\ConditionsController` class which allows to run arbitrary PHP code by escalating the object creation calling some methods available in `\\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream`. Using this vulnerability in combination with The Imagick Extension and MSL which stands for Magick Scripting Language, a full RCE can be achieved. MSL is a built-in ImageMagick language that facilitates the reading of images, performance of image processing tasks, and writing of results back to the filesystem.

The module first performs a check to see if the target is WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected, the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in order to print a random string via the echo command. This is done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php. If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector is leveraged to execute the payload. This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital MyCloud version 2.30.183. Note: based on the available disclosures, it seems that the command injection vector (CVE-2016-10108) might be exploitable without the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) on versions before 2.21.126.

          "description": "InvoiceShelf is an open-source web & mobile app that helps you track expenses, payments, create professional invoices & estimates and is based on the PHP framework Laravel. InvoiceShelf has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to conduct PHP deserialization attacks. This is possible when the `SESSION_DRIVER=cookie` option is set on the default InvoiceShelf .env file meaning that any session will be stored as a ciphered value inside a cookie. These sessions are made from a specially crafted JSON containing serialized data which is then ciphered using Laravel's encrypt() function. An attacker in possession of the `APP_KEY` would therefore be able to retrieve the cookie, uncipher it and modify the serialized data in order to get arbitrary deserialization on the affected server, allowing them to achieve remote command execution. InvoiceShelf version `1.3.0` and lower is vulnerable. As it allows remote code execution, adversaries could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands, potentially resulting in complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.",

The module first attempts to obtain the Cacti version to see if the target is affected. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are not set, the module will try to bruteforce the missing value(s). If a valid combination is found, the module will use these to attempt exploitation. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are both set, the module will immediately attempt exploitation. During exploitation, the module sends a GET request to /remote_agent.php with the action parameter set to polldata and the X-Forwarded-For header set to the provided value for X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP (by default 127.0.0.1). In addition, the poller_id parameter is set to the payload and the host_id and local_data_id parameters are set to the bruteforced or provided values. If X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP is set to an address that is resolvable to a hostname in the poller table, and the local_data_id and host_id values are vulnerable, the payload set for poller_id will be executed by the target. This module has been successfully tested against Cacti version 1.2.22 running on Ubuntu 21.10 (vulhub docker image)",

          "description": "This module leverages an authentication bypass and directory traversal vulnerabilities in Saltstack Salt's REST API to execute commands remotely on the `master` as the root user. Every 60 seconds, `salt-master` service performs a maintenance process check that reloads and executes all the `grains` on the `master`, including custom grain modules in the Extension Module directory. So, this module simply creates a Python script at this location and waits for it to be executed. The time interval is set to 60 seconds by default but can be changed in the `master` configuration file with the `loop_interval` option.

          "description": "This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in rConfig version 3.9 in order to execute arbitrary commands. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `path` parameter of the ajax archive file functionality within the rConfig web interface in order to execute the payload. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However, this module can bypass authentication via SQLI. This module has been successfully tested on Rconfig 3.9.3 and 3.9.4. The steps are: 1. SQLi on /commands.inc.php allows us to add an administrative user. 2. An authenticated session is established with the newly added user 3. Command Injection on /lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxArchiveFiles.php allows us to execute the payload. 4. Remove the added admin user. Tips : once you get a shell, look at the CVE-2019-19585. You will probably get root because rConfig install script add Apache user to sudoers with nopasswd ;-)",

          "description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the yrange parameter in OpenTSDB through 2.4.0 (CVE-2020-35476) in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. The module first attempts to obtain the OpenTSDB version via the api. If the version is 2.4.0 or lower, the module performs additional checks to obtain the configured metrics and aggregators. It then randomly selects one metric and one aggregator and uses those to instruct the target server to plot a graph. As part of this request, the yrange parameter is set to the payload, which will then be executed by the target if the latter is vulnerable. This module has been successfully tested against OpenTSDB version 2.3.0.",

QTS is a core part of the firmware for numerous QNAP entry and mid-level Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, and QuTS hero is a core part of the firmware for numerous QNAP high-end and enterprise NAS devices. The vulnerable endpoint is the quick.cgi component, exposed by the device's web based administration feature. The quick.cgi component is present in an uninitialized QNAP NAS device. This component is intended to be used during either manual or cloud based provisioning of a QNAP NAS device. Once a device has been successfully initialized, the quick.cgi component is disabled on the system. An attacker with network access to an uninitialized QNAP NAS device may perform unauthenticated command injection, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.",

The path traversal allows a remote and authenticated administrator to upload a PHP web shell and execute code as `www-data`. The module achieves this by creating an autodiscovery job with an `id` field containing a path traversal to a writable and remotely accessible directory, and `custom_ports` field containing the web shell. A cron file will be created using the chosen path and file name, and the web shell is embedded in the file. After the web shell has been written to the victim, this module will then use the web shell to establish a Meterpreter session or a reverse shell. By default, the web shell is deleted by the module, and the autodiscovery job is removed as well.",

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the 'password' and 'new password' parameter within the router's web interface. Attackers can inject a command in the 'password' or 'new password' parameter, encoded in base64, to exploit the command injection vulnerability. When exploited, this can lead to command execution, potentially allowing the attacker to take full control of the router.

Attackers can inject a command in the 'password' or 'new password' parameter, encoded in base64, to exploit the command injection vulnerability. When exploited, this can lead to command execution, potentially allowing the attacker to take full control of the router. An attacker needs to be authenticated to initiate this RCE, however CVE-2024-48457 allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset the Wifi and router password, hence gaining full root access to the router to execute the RCE. Last but not least, CVE-2024-48455 allows for unauthenticated information disclosure revealing sensitive configuration information of the router which can be used by the attacker to determine if the router is running specific vulnerable firmware.

Provided credentials can be used to execute the RCE directly 2. A JWT token from an agent can be provided to emulate a compromised host. If a logged in user attempts to execute a command on the host the returned value contains an xss payload. 3. Similar to technique 2, an agent executable can be provided and the JWT token can be extracted. Verified against CHAOS 7d5b20ad7e58e5b525abdcb3a12514b88e87cef2 running in a docker container.",

The vulnerability can be triggered by anybody with API access (compromised dashboard or Wazuh servers in the cluster) or, in certain configurations, even by a compromised agent.",

This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges. This module has been successfully tested on Pandora 7.0 NG 744 running on CentOS 7 (the official virtual appliance ISO for this version).",

This exploit requires post-authentication using the `Admin-Token` cookie/sessionID (`SID`), typically stolen by the attacker.

          "description": "This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability affecting Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Services. This exploit is executed through the ASA's ASDM web server and lands in the FirePower Services SFR module's Linux virtual machine as the root user. Access to the virtual machine allows the attacker to pivot to the inside network, and access the outside network. Also, the SFR virtual machine is running snort on the traffic flowing through the ASA, so the attacker should have access to this diverted traffic as well. This module requires ASDM credentials in order to traverse the ASDM interface. A similar attack can be performed via Cisco CLI (over SSH), although that isn't implemented here. Finally, it's worth noting that this attack bypasses the affects of the `lockdown-sensor` command (e.g. the virtual machine's bash shell shouldn't be available but this attack makes it available). Cisco assigned this issue CVE-2022-20828. The issue affects all Cisco ASA that support the ASA FirePOWER module (at least Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Service, and Cisco ISA 3000). The vulnerability has been patched in ASA FirePOWER module versions 6.2.3.19, 6.4.0.15, 6.6.7, and 7.0.21. The following versions will receive no patch: 6.2.2 and earlier, 6.3.*, 6.5.*, and 6.7.*.",

          "description": "This module exploits CVE-2022-0543, a Lua-based Redis sandbox escape. The vulnerability was introduced by Debian and Ubuntu Redis packages that insufficiently sanitized the Lua environment. The maintainers failed to disable the package interface, allowing attackers to load arbitrary libraries. On a typical `redis` deployment (not docker), this module achieves execution as the `redis` user. Debian/Ubuntu packages run Redis using systemd with the \"MemoryDenyWriteExecute\" permission, which limits some of what an attacker can do. For example, staged meterpreter will fail when attempting to use mprotect. As such, stageless meterpreter is the preferred payload. Redis can be configured with authentication or not. This module will work with either configuration (provided you provide the correct authentication details). This vulnerability could theoretically be exploited across a few architectures: i386, arm, ppc, etc. However, the module only supports x86_64, which is likely to be the most popular version.",

          "description": "This module gains a session with root permissions on versions of OS X with sudo binary vulnerable to CVE-2013-1775. Tested working on Mac OS 10.7-10.8.4, and possibly lower versions. If your session belongs to a user with Administrative Privileges (the user is in the sudoers file and is in the \"admin group\"), and the user has ever run the \"sudo\" command, it is possible to become the super user by running `sudo -k` and then resetting the system clock to 01-01-1970. This module will fail silently if the user is not an admin, if the user has never run the sudo command, or if the admin has locked the Date/Time preferences. Note: If the user has locked the Date/Time preferences, requests to overwrite the system clock will be ignored, and the module will silently fail. However, if the \"Require an administrator password to access locked preferences\" setting is not enabled, the Date/Time preferences are often unlocked every time the admin logs in, so you can install persistence and wait for a chance later.",

The PHP connector component allows unauthenticated users to upload files and perform file modification operations, such as resizing and rotation of an image. The file name of uploaded files is not validated, allowing shell metacharacters. When performing image operations on JPEG files, the filename is passed to the `exiftran` utility without appropriate sanitization, causing shell commands in the file name to be executed, resulting in remote command injection as the web server user. The PHP connector is not enabled by default. The system must have `exiftran` installed and in `$PATH`. This module has been tested successfully on elFinder versions 2.1.47, 2.1.20 and 2.1.16 on Ubuntu.",

NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application may hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. For the Linux target, the MeterpreterTryToFork option (enabled by default) will likely prevent this. If the app hangs, closing the session should render it responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.",

          "description": "This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root.",

The exploitation process leverages a weakness in the XSLT transformation functionality of Splunk. Successful exploitation requires valid credentials, typically 'admin:changeme' by default. The exploit involves uploading a malicious XSLT file to the target system. This file, when processed by the vulnerable Splunk server, leads to the execution of arbitrary code. The module then utilizes the 'runshellscript' capability in Splunk to execute the payload, which can be tailored to establish a reverse shell. This provides the attacker with remote control over the compromised Splunk instance. The module is designed to work seamlessly, ensuring successful exploitation under the right conditions.",

Remote Command Execution is possible via a correctly formatted HTTP X-XSRF-TOKEN header, due to an insecure unserialize call of the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php. Authentication is not required, however exploitation requires knowledge of the Laravel APP_KEY. Similar vulnerabilities appear to exist within Laravel cookie tokens based on the code fix. In some cases the APP_KEY is leaked which allows for discovery and exploitation.",

Authentication is bypassed by using ZDI-20-703 (aka CVE-2020-10923), an authentication bypass that occurs when network adjacent computers send SOAPAction UPnP messages to a vulnerable Netgear R6700v3 router.

Once the password has been reset, attackers can use the exploit/linux/telnet/netgear_telnetenable module to send a special packet to port 23/udp of the router to enable a telnet server on port 23/tcp. The attacker can then log into this telnet server using the new password, and obtain a shell as the \"root\" user. These last two steps have to be done manually, as the authors did not reverse the communication with the web interface. It should be noted that successful exploitation will result in the upnpd binary crashing on the target router. As the upnpd binary will not restart until the router is rebooted, this means that attackers can only exploit this vulnerability once per reboot of the router.

The service is known to be used on Moxa devices in the NPort, OnCell, and MGate product lines. A discovery packet compels a Moxa device to respond to the sender with some basic device information that is needed for more advanced functions. The discovery data is 8 bytes in length and is the most basic example of the Moxa protocol. It may be sent out as a broadcast (destination 255.255.255.255) or to an individual device. Devices that respond to this query may be vulnerable to serious information disclosure vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2016-9361. The module is the work of Patrick DeSantis of Cisco Talos and is derived from original work by K. Reid Wightman. Tested and validated on a Moxa NPort 6250 with firmware versions 1.13 and 1.15.",

To exploit this vulnerability, a valid OneDev project name is required. If anonymous access is enabled on the OneDev server, any visitor can view existing projects without authentication. However, when anonymous access is disabled, an attacker who lacks prior knowledge of existing project names can use a brute-force approach. By providing a user-supplied wordlist, the module may be able to guess a valid project name and subsequently exploit the vulnerability.",

          "description": "Acronis Cyber Protect or Backup is an enterprise backup/recovery solution for all, compute, storage and application resources. Businesses and Service Providers are using it to protect and backup all IT assets in their IT environment. This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability at the Acronis Cyber Protect appliance which, in its default configuration, allows the anonymous registration of new backup/protection agents on new endpoints. This API endpoint also generates bearer tokens which the agent then uses to authenticate to the appliance. As the management web console is running on the same port as the API for the agents, this bearer token is also valid for any actions on the web console. This allows an attacker with network access to the appliance to start the registration of a new agent, retrieve a bearer token that provides admin access to the available functions in the web console. This module will gather all machine info (endpoints) configured and managed by the appliance. This information can be used in a subsequent attack that exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on both the managed endpoint and the appliance. This exploit is covered in another module `exploit/multi/acronis_cyber_protect_unauth_rce_cve_2022_3405`. Acronis Cyber Protect 15 (Windows, Linux) before build 29486 and Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 (Windows, Linux) before build 16545 are vulnerable.",

          "description": "This module utilizes the Jenkins cli protocol to run the `help` command. The cli is accessible with read-only permissions by default, which are all thats required. Jenkins cli utilizes `args4j's` `parseArgument`, which calls `expandAtFiles` to replace any `@<filename>` with the contents of a file. We are then able to retrieve the error message to read up to the first two lines of a file. Exploitation by hand can be done with the cli, see markdown documents for additional instructions. There are a few exploitation oddities: 1. The injection point for the `help` command requires 2 input arguments. When the `expandAtFiles` is called, each line of the `FILE_PATH` becomes an input argument. If a file only contains one line, it will throw an error: `ERROR: You must authenticate to access this Jenkins.` However, we can pad out the content by supplying a first argument. 2. There is a strange timing requirement where the `download` (or first) request must get to the server first, but the `upload` (or second) request must be very close behind it. From testing against the docker image, it was found values between `.01` and `1.9` were viable. Due to the round trip time of the first request and response happening before request 2 would be received, it is necessary to use threading to ensure the requests happen within rapid succession.
